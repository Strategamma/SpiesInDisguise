Original prompt: Ok now let's work on the game UI. Add a how to play section. Make the UI clean, mobile first and easy to understand. Design the cards better

- Started UI audit. Preserve game logic, hidden-information behavior, existing brand mark, and navy/mint visual direction.
- Added visible home onboarding, a detailed three-step field briefing, explicit win/loss conditions, and a full contact dossier.
- Redesigned cards around contact identity, short effect copy, labeled 1st/2nd/3rd movement, clear selection/revealed states, and a simpler concealed card.
- Reworked the mobile hand into a two-column grid and clarified the two-step offer flow.
- Syntax and all five rules tests pass. Added concise `render_game_to_text` and time-step hooks for game-state QA.
- Screenshot runner could not launch Chromium because macOS denied its Mach rendezvous service inside the execution sandbox. No screenshot was produced; do not claim visual QA completed.
- TODO: visually check home, rules dialog, and bot hand at 320–430px when browser execution is available; verify there are no overflow or sticky-action issues.
